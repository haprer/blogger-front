        content: `My name is Lt. Aldo Raine and I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers. 
        Eight Jewish-American soldiers. Now, y'all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon. Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier. 
        We're gonna be dropped into France, dressed as civilians. And once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhackin' guerrilla army, 
        we're gonna be doin' one thing and one thing only... killin' Nazis. Now, I don't know about y'all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the 
        goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross five thousand miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fuckin' air-o-plane to 
        teach the Nazis lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin', mass murderin' maniac and they 
        need to be dee-stroyed. That's why any and every every son of a bitch we find wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die. Now, I'm the direct 
        descendant of the mountain man Jim Bridger. That means I got a little Injun in me. And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance. 
        We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty they will know who we are. And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the 
        disemboweled, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the German won't not be able to help themselves but 
        to imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the German will be sickened by 
        us, and the German will talk about us, and the German will fear us. And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their 
        subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us they are tortured with. Sound good?`,
